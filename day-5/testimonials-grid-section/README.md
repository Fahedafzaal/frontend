## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- TypeScript

### What I learned

The main challenges in this project were:

1. **CSS Grid Layout with Order**: Using CSS Grid's `order` property to create the specific layout where cards appear in different positions on larger screens while maintaining a logical flow on mobile.

2. **Z-index Stacking Context**: Managing the SVG quotation pattern to appear behind the text content while staying above the card background. This required careful positioning and z-index management.

3. **Responsive Design**: Implementing a mobile-first approach that gracefully scales to desktop layouts using Tailwind's responsive utilities.

4. **Component Architecture**: Building reusable Card components that can accept children for additional content like the SVG pattern.

### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on in future projects:

- Advanced CSS Grid techniques and complex layouts
- Better understanding of stacking contexts and z-index behavior
- Performance optimization for React components
- Accessibility improvements and semantic HTML structure

### Useful resources
