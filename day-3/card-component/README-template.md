## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type safety
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first responsive design
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Picture element for responsive images

### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

**Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS**
- Using Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:) for mobile-first design
- Implementing responsive images with the `<picture>` element and `srcSet`
- Creating flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes

**React Component Structure**
- Building clean, reusable component architecture

**CSS Flexbox**
- Using Flexbox for complex layouts
- Creating responsive card layouts that work on all devices
- Using CSS custom properties for consistent theming

**Vite Build System**
- Setting up a modern development environment with Vite
- Configuring TypeScript with Vite
- Understanding the build process and optimization

### Continued development

Areas I want to focus on in future projects:

- **Advanced TypeScript patterns** - Implementing more complex type definitions and interfaces
- **State management** - Exploring Redux, Zustand, or React Context for larger applications
- **Testing** - Adding unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- **Performance optimization** - Implementing lazy loading, code splitting, and performance monitoring
- **Accessibility** - Improving ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Animation libraries** - Exploring Framer Motion or similar libraries for smooth interactions
